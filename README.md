## 4:53PM

Added Second border that acts as an overlay and will be the one to have the spin effect

## 5:11PM

- Run into 2 blockers
  > 1. div no longer spins on hover but rest of animation works
  > 2. Conceptually, I think the spin effect should be done by using the ::after pseudoselector on our button, and have our animated div have a transparent border, with our ::after containing our gradient info, but i can't figure out how to make the "line" effect instead of just having one long gradient for the border.

## 5:17PM

- Removed the prop that was preventing our animation from starting (`initial: "hover"`), researching border effect now

## 5:19PM

- Hmm.

## 5:21PM

- Began thinking about using border length for animation

## 5:33PM

- Created a css file that began to show concept for getting our border animation to work before we'd convert it into framer-motion animation, but ran out of time.
- Left our spinning border in since it was silly
